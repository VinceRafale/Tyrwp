Underscores Theme w/ Foundation-5
===

This is a modification to the [_s (underscores)](http://underscores.me/) Wordpress theme by [Automatic](http://automattic.com/). All features of _s are not present in this versions but most are. The main reason for the modification was to include [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) into a Wordpress theme. _s appears is a very basic and minimalistic base to allow you to quickly get up and running without having to remove unwanted or un needed styles.

In this theme, all _s CSS has been removed and replaced with foundation required CSS. 
This theme is setup to use SASS precompiling. If you do not want to use SASS, the style.css file is already compiled with basics and you can use standard CSS by editing the file directly.


Getting Started
---------------

Here is how to set this thing up:

1. Clone the repository into your Wordpress `themes` folder.
2. Change the name of the cloned folder from `Underscores-Theme-w--Foundation-5` to `yourThemeName` .
3. Use a find and replace to change `foundation5_s` to the name of your theme in all the template files.
4. Update the stylesheet header in style.css.scss located in the SASS folder.
5. Update or delete this readme.
6. Activate your theme and start customizing.

You're ready to go.

Good luck!
